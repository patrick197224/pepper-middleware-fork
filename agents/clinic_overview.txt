A normal consultation is usually scheduled for 15 minutes with a general practitioner or 20 minutes for complex chronic care review. Follow-up consultations for stable chronic disease are often booked with the physician assistant under the supervision of a general practitioner.

Scope and limitations of services
GreenOak Family Practice is a generalist clinic and does not provide emergency medicine, advanced imaging, or surgical procedures. Normal practice policies include:
- Immediate referral to emergency services for life-threatening symptoms such as chest pain suggestive of myocardial infarction, severe shortness of breath, or stroke symptoms.
- Referral to specialist care for complex or unstable conditions beyond the general practitioner’s scope, such as suspected cancer, complex autoimmune disease, or severe psychiatric illness.
- No provision of long-term opioid management for chronic non-cancer pain without specialist involvement.
- No performance of major surgical procedures, obstetric deliveries, or inpatient care; these are referred to hospital-based services.

Quality and data documentation practices
The practice uses an electronic health record (EHR) system to document all encounters, diagnoses, medications, lab results, and referrals. Typical data elements recorded during routine visits include:
- Patient demographics, reason for encounter, and symptom description.
- Vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, weight, and BMI.
- Diagnoses coded according to standard primary care classification systems.
- Medications with dose, frequency, indication, and start or modification date.
- Planned follow-up interval and any pending tests or referrals.

GreenOak Family Practice periodically reviews key performance indicators such as patient satisfaction feedback, average waiting time for routine appointments, vaccination coverage for children in the practice, and adherence to chronic disease follow-up intervals. These metrics are used internally to improve accessibility, continuity of care, and clinical outcomes.
